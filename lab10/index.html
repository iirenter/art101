		<h1>Lab 10 -JavaScript Events and Forms  </h1>
		<p> Working with your partner, experiment with JS events</p>

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p> Creating the button and button click js event whent pretty smoothly. What gave me a little trouble was re-working my sortUserName function from lab 8 to take the name written in the prompt field and to write the result of the sort onto the webpage. However after a little trial and error We figured it out</p>

		<h2> Results</h2>
		<p>Input your Name:<br>
			<input type= 'text' id= "user-name">
		</p>
		<button id= "my-button">
			Press Me
		</button>

		<p>You can see the output printed below </p>
