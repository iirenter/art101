	<h1>Lab3: File Structures and File Transfer</h1>
	<p> The purpose of this lab is to teach us how to create, navigate, and manage a file structure. Also how to transfer local files to an online server. </p>

	<h2>Difficulties</h2>
	<p> The creating the file structure was easy but I had trouble with getting some of the html files to do what I wanted since I'm still not sure how to use all the keywords and tagnames.</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> Well now I have a well laid out file structure filled with several html and image files. Soon this will all be uploaded to github for anyone to look at.</p>

	<p>The file structure on my computer</p>

	<p>The html file for my mainpage</p>
