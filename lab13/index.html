			<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p> I couldn't get my function to run for the longest time or so I thought. The problem was it wasn't appending the output div so it was running but you just weren't seeing anything happening. After I fixed that proble it kept skipping a few line of the function but that turned out to be the result of a small syntax error in the conditional statements of those lines.</p>
