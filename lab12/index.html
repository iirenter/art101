			<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p> I didn't have too much trouble until I tried runing my conditional statement and it kept returning undefined. After looking closely at it I was mising a semicolon on the line that got the length of the string. Also the line that retreved the name was mising .value which also gave it trouble.</p>

		<h2> Results</h2>
		<p> A Conditional statement that sorts you into a hogwarts house. I think the js could be done in less lines using the jquery things we used in lab 11 but I just kept it simple to make sure it worked.</p>
		<h2>Welcome to Hogwarts</h2>
